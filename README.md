# A PyTorch implementation of V-Net

Vnet is a [PyTorch](http://pytorch.org/) implementation of the paper
[V-Net: Fully Convolutional Neural Networks for Volumetric Medical Image Segmentation](https://arxiv.org/abs/1606.04797)
by Fausto Milletari, Nassir Navab, and Seyed-Ahmad Ahmadi. This implementation is based on the official version [faustomilletari/VNet](https://github.com/faustomilletari/VNet) and the pytorch version by [mattmacy/vnet.pytorch](https://github.com/mattmacy/vnet.pytorch).

To apply the codes, only need to slightly modify "main.py", and "DataManager.py"/"train.py" where marked as "require customization"
